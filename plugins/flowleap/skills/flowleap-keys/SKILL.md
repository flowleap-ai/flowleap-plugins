description: Manage BYOK patent-data keys (EPO OPS consumer key/secret, USPTO ODP API key) for the FlowLeap CLI — check status, validate live, hand off to a human for the interactive setup wizard, and apply the key-gate doctrine (a gated office is a user-action stop, never an exhausted route). Trigger when a FlowLeap command fails with provider_keys_required or provider_keys_invalid, when patent data calls error about EPO/USPTO credentials, or when the user asks to configure provider keys.

# FlowLeap Patent-Data Keys (BYOK)

In a chat client with the FlowLeap connector, call the tools named in the `flowleap-shared` connector table instead of these commands. No tool replaces the keys commands: the user adds a stored key on the Patent-data keys page, and you never ask for the key value in the chat.

Patent data flows through provider APIs that may need the USER's own
credentials: EPO OPS (consumer key + secret — always a pair) and USPTO ODP
(single API key). The concept is **patent-data keys**; `provider_keys_required`
and `provider_keys_invalid` are the wire codes that name it in error envelopes.
A key reaches the backend in one of two ways:

- **Forwarded key** — kept on this machine in `credentials.toml` (0600) and
  sent with each request as `x-epo-ops-key` / `x-epo-ops-secret` /
  `x-uspto-odp-key`. The CLI never prints it (verbose/dry-run redact). A
  forwarded key always wins for its office.
- **Stored key** — the human adds it once on the FlowLeap "Patent-data keys"
  page (https://www.flowleap.co/en/dashboard/keys). FlowLeap keeps it
  encrypted and never shows the value again. It is used when the request
  carries no forwarded key for that office.

The gate applies wherever patent data is read — the commands and the Tools
facade alike, since the commands run on the facade. Key validation
(`keys test`, `keys set`) runs outside the facade and works before a
subscription exists, so setup can always be diagnosed.

## Diagnose

```bash
flowleap --json keys list    # what's configured locally (masked); alias: keys status
flowleap --json keys test    # live verdicts: source user|stored|server|none, valid true|false|null
flowleap --json doctor       # providerKeys section + pending steps in nextSteps
```

`source` names the key a data call uses for that office: `user` (a forwarded
key), `stored` (the user's stored key), `server` (the backend's own keys) or
`none`. `keys test` needing nothing locally is fine when `source` is `stored`
or `server` — commands work without a local key.

`source` is that closed union and nothing else. When a provider was never
reached — an EPO failure short-circuits the USPTO check — its verdict carries
`source: null` with `checked: false` and `valid: null`, meaning "no verdict",
not "no key". Read `checked` before concluding anything about a provider. A
provider that is invalid or missing everywhere makes `keys test` exit **9**,
the same patent-data-key code a gated data command returns.

Doctor's `nextSteps` lists patent-data keys only when they actually **block**
work: providers with a stored key or server coverage produce no steps (doctor
reports the source per office in `keyValidation.providers`). A blocking
provider appears as an obtain/store pair — `obtain-epo-keys` /
`obtain-uspto-key` (`actor: "human"`, carries the signup `url` — relay it to
the user) then `store-epo-keys` / `store-uspto-key` (`actor: "agent"`, carries
the `run` command — execute it only when the user hands you the keys without
being asked; otherwise the human adds the key on the Patent-data keys page) —
followed by `verify-keys` (`actor: "agent"`, runs `keys test`). A stored key
the office rejected is different: doctor gives one `store-*` step with
`actor: "human"` and the page `url` ("Replace your … key"), then
`verify-keys`. A key-gate error names the same step ids with `actor: "human"`:
that is the page route, and doctor shows no step once the stored key is
present. When doctor cannot reach the validation endpoint
(unauthenticated/offline) it falls back to local key presence and says so in
`keyValidation.note`. See `flowleap-shared` for the
full `nextSteps`/`ready`/exit contract.

## Which codes mean gated

Exactly four backend codes, all from the closed error-code registry. They never
change once shipped, so they are the only safe thing to match on:

| Backend code | Status | Meaning |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| `data_keys_required` | 400 | The user pays, forwarded no patent-data key for this office, and the server fallback is denied. Carries `provider`. Never a 402 — this is not a billing problem |
| `patent_provider_key_invalid` | 400 | The user's own key was rejected upstream. Carries `provider`. Never a passthrough 401/403, which clients map to re-sign-in |
| `odp_api_key_missing` | 503 | No USPTO ODP key configured server-side and none forwarded |
| `trial_data_budget_exhausted` | 429 | Trial only (backend ADR 0017): today's SHARED trial data budget on FlowLeap's credentials is spent. Carries `provider` and `resets_at`, plus Retry-After. Lifts on its own at the next UTC day; the user's own free keys lift it permanently |

The CLI folds those four into one `providerKeysHint` on the JSON error
envelope, with its own `code` (`provider_keys_required`,
`provider_keys_invalid`, or `trial_budget_exhausted`) and the `provider`.
Either layer is a valid match; both are codes.

**The budget gate is the soft one.** `trial_budget_exhausted` follows the same
doctrine below (never substitute scraped data, keys are free, ask the user),
with one extra exit: the hint carries `resetsAt`, so with the user's blessing an
agent may also pause the gated office until then instead of requiring keys now.
A success envelope may warn first: a `trial_data_budget_low` entry in
`body.warnings` (with `remaining` and `resets_at`) means the wall is near —
finish the current work, then surface the key ask.

**Never match on message text.** Backend wording is freely editable by policy, so
a reword must not be able to invent or erase a gate. An error whose *message*
mentions `EPO_CLIENT_ID` but whose *code* is something else is not a gate — and
a gate whose message changes tomorrow is still a gate. Read `error.code` (or
`providerKeysHint.code`); ignore the prose.

## The key-gate doctrine

**A key gate is a USER-ACTION STOP, never an exhausted route.** A gate means
that office needs a key only the user can obtain — it is not a transient error,
not a zero-result, and not a route you have exhausted. So for the gated office:

- **Never substitute web-scraped data for it** — not for searches, and not for
  single-document reads. "Give me the claims of EP…" with no EPO OPS key is
  declined *for that office* with the key named as the one-step fix; it is never
  quietly served from Google Patents, Espacenet, freepatentsonline, or a web
  search instead. Only the user adding the key opens that office.
- **The keys are FREE** from each office (EPO OPS and USPTO ODP both issue them
  at no cost, browser signup). Never frame the ask as a paywall, an upsell, or a
  FlowLeap limitation.
- **A gate is READ, never INFERRED.** An office is gated only when a command you
  actually ran returned an explicit gate **code** (the exact set is in
  "Which codes mean gated" below). Never conclude a gate from an empty result
  set, a truncated or partial payload, a 5xx, a timeout, from an error message
  that happens to name a credential, or from `keys list` showing nothing.
  Anything short of those codes is an ordinary dead or empty route, and normal
  persistence and fallbacks apply to it in full — reformulate, try the alternate
  office or route, then the usual web fallback.
- The forbid rule covers **only** an office gated on a missing patent-data key.
  Offices with no backend route at all (CN/JP/KR) and routes that are genuinely
  dead or empty *with a working key* keep their existing fallbacks unchanged.

**Where the human adds the key.** The human adds the key on the FlowLeap
"Patent-data keys" page (https://www.flowleap.co/en/dashboard/keys) or in the
client's own key setting (`flowleap setup` / `flowleap keys set` for this CLI).
A stored key from that page is used whenever no forwarded key is present, so
one visit to the page opens the office on every surface. When the hint carries
`keysPageUrl` or a `nextStep`, give the human that link.

**Never ask for the key value in the chat.** A key typed into a chat reaches
the transcript and every log that keeps it. Give the human the page link or
the local setup command instead; the human types the key there.

**Proceed, then ask.** When one provider is live and the other is gated:

1. Complete the LIVE office fully — every search, read, and analysis the task
   asks of it. A missing key for one office is not a reason to do less work in
   the other.
2. Deliver those results as the normal deliverable.
3. Name the gap explicitly as a **missing-key gap**, never as a data or coverage
   finding: "EP coverage is missing because your EPO OPS key is not set" — not
   "no EP results were found", not "EP coverage is limited", not silence.
4. Ask for the missing key once, at the END of the turn, after the results.
5. **Never silently narrow scope.** A prior-art, novelty, patentability,
   freedom-to-operate, invalidity, or landscape task keeps the scope the work
   requires; the unsearched office is stated as an open gap in the deliverable,
   so no one mistakes a configuration detail for a clearance result.

**Keyless pivot — offer it as DIFFERENT data, never as a substitute.** These
need no patent-data key and stay live while an office is gated; label each for
what it actually is:

- `flowleap patstat …` (portfolio, guarded SQL, graph) — aggregates from a
  twice-yearly SNAPSHOT, not documents and not current. It does not answer
  "what prior art exists for this claim".
- `flowleap legal search …` — patent LAW (MPEP, EPC, guidelines). It gives the
  legal standard, never what has been published or filed.
- `flowleap academic search …` / `flowleap npl …` — scholarly LITERATURE. Papers
  are prior art in their own right, but they are a different corpus from patents.

Say plainly that this is different data, not a stand-in for the gated office's
live search.

**Resume — merge, do not restart.** When the user says they added the missing
key, re-run ONLY the previously gated office and merge its results into the
deliverable you already produced. Do not redo the live office's work. Keys reach
the request headers on the next invocation: no restart, no new session.

## The agent protocol — when keys are missing or rejected

Failed commands carry a `providerKeysHint` in the JSON error envelope, raised
from the four backend codes above and from nothing else (a
`trial_budget_exhausted` hint additionally carries `resetsAt`). Only while
the backend keeps stored keys, a `provider_keys_required` hint, and a
`provider_keys_invalid` hint when the rejected key is the stored key, also
carry `keysPageUrl` and a `nextStep` with `actor: "human"` — the same shape and
ids as doctor's `nextSteps`. A `trial_budget_exhausted` hint never carries
them. Relay the step's `title` and `url` to the human:

```json
"providerKeysHint": {
  "code": "provider_keys_required",      // or provider_keys_invalid / trial_budget_exhausted
  "provider": "epo",
  "requiresHumanIntervention": true,
  "nonInteractive": { "command": "flowleap keys set epo --key … --secret …",
                       "env": ["FLOWLEAP_EPO_KEY", "FLOWLEAP_EPO_SECRET"] },
  "signup": "https://developers.epo.org (free, 'My apps' → create app)",
  "keysPageUrl": "https://www.flowleap.co/en/dashboard/keys",
  "nextStep": { "id": "store-epo-keys", "actor": "human",
                "title": "Add your EPO OPS consumer key and secret on the FlowLeap Patent-data keys page",
                "url": "https://www.flowleap.co/en/dashboard/keys" }
}
```

**Getting keys requires a browser signup — an agent cannot complete this
alone. Do not retry, do not invent keys.** Tell the user:

> This command needs EPO OPS credentials (free from https://developers.epo.org).
> Please add them on the FlowLeap Patent-data keys page
> (https://www.flowleap.co/en/dashboard/keys), or run `flowleap setup` in a
> terminal (guided, ~2 minutes), then I'll continue.

Do not ask the user to paste the key into the chat. If the user hands you keys
without being asked, apply them non-interactively — they are validated live
before saving, and rejected keys are NOT saved:

```bash
flowleap --json keys set epo --key <consumer-key> --secret <consumer-secret>
flowleap --json keys set uspto --key <api-key>
flowleap --json keys test
```

Or per-session via env: `FLOWLEAP_EPO_KEY`, `FLOWLEAP_EPO_SECRET`,
`FLOWLEAP_USPTO_KEY`.

## Human commands (mention, never run yourself)

`flowleap setup` — full onboarding wizard (backend check → auth check →
per-provider prompts with hidden input, live validation, skippable steps with
explicit warnings). Refuses to run without a TTY. `flowleap keys rm epo|uspto`
removes stored keys.
