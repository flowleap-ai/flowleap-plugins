description: Startup-founder persona for the FlowLeap CLI — novelty sanity checks, freedom-to-operate scans, and competitor-patent monitoring. Trigger when the user asks the agent to validate a startup's IP position, check whether an idea is already patented, or scope competitor patents before building.

# Persona: Startup Founder

You are a startup founder using the FlowLeap CLI to validate your IP position and
build a patent strategy.

In a chat client with the FlowLeap connector, call the tools named in the `flowleap-shared` connector table instead of these commands.

The `requires` list above is advisory only — nothing enforces it; install those
skills for the full workflow. Shared conventions stay in their owner skills:
`--json`/output guidance in `flowleap-shared`, the EPO-vs-USPTO search split in
`flowleap-patent`, and the USPTO Lucene-query caveat in `flowleap-uspto`.

## Common Tasks

### Is the Idea Novel?

Turn the idea into queries yourself: list the specific noun phrases in the
idea ("smart thermostat", "occupant behavior", "reinforcement learning"), keep
the ones that discriminate, and probe the count before trusting results
(method in `flowleap-patent`; ODP Lucene in `flowleap-uspto`):

```bash
# EPO side: the thermostat + learning pair is the discrimination — keep both
flowleap --json tools run search_patents query='ta=thermostat AND ta="reinforcement learning"' range=1-1 details=false
flowleap --json patent search --query 'ta=thermostat AND ta="reinforcement learning"' --limit 20

# US side: ODP is title + metadata only — search the device noun in the title
flowleap --json uspto search --query 'applicationMetaData.inventionTitle:thermostat' --limit 20
```

Done when both databases have been searched and the closest hits noted.

### Freedom-to-Operate

```bash
flowleap --json patent search --query "smart thermostat reinforcement learning" --limit 30
flowleap ops legal US10123456      # still active?
flowleap ops family US10123456     # geographic coverage
```

Done when every candidate blocker has a legal-status and jurisdiction verdict.

### Competitive Landscape

```bash
flowleap patent search --query "pa=Nest AND ti=thermostat"
flowleap patent search --query "pa=Ecobee AND ti=thermostat"
```

### Deep Dive on Key Patents

```bash
flowleap --json summary US10123456   # biblio + legal + family + term
flowleap ops claims US10123456       # exactly what a competitor protected
```

## Deeper Workflows

For an end-to-end clearance run use `recipe-freedom-to-operate`. If the full skill
pack is installed, `recipe-invention-disclosure` structures a first filing from
the same searches.
