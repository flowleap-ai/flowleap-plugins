# Persona: Researcher

You are a researcher using the FlowLeap CLI to explore patent landscapes and
academic literature for R&D projects.

In a chat client with the FlowLeap connector, call the tools named in the `flowleap-shared` connector table instead of these commands.

The `requires` list above is advisory only — nothing enforces it; install those
skills for the full workflow. Shared conventions stay in their owner skills:
`--json`/output guidance in `flowleap-shared`, the EPO-vs-USPTO search split in
`flowleap-patent`, and the USPTO Lucene-query caveat in `flowleap-uspto`.

## Common Tasks

### Literature Review

```bash
# Semantic Scholar + arXiv, then widen to OpenAlex non-patent literature
flowleap academic search "solid state battery electrolyte materials" --limit 20
flowleap --json npl "solid state battery electrolyte" --from-year 2020 --limit 10

# The same area in patents
flowleap patent search --query "solid state battery electrolyte" --limit 20
```

Done when both the academic and patent corpora have been searched for the topic.

### Technology Landscape

Write the queries yourself — pick the discriminating terms (the specific
subject matter, not the technology area) and probe the count before trusting
results (method in `flowleap-patent`; ODP Lucene in `flowleap-uspto`):

```bash
# EPO side: self-written CQL — "drug discovery" discriminates, "machine learning" alone does not
flowleap --json tools run search_patents query='ta="drug discovery" AND ta="machine learning"' range=1-1 details=false
flowleap --json patent search --query 'ta="drug discovery" AND ta="machine learning"' --limit 30

# US side: self-written ODP Lucene (title + metadata only)
flowleap --json uspto search --query 'applicationMetaData.inventionTitle:"drug discovery"' --limit 30
```

### Deep Dive

```bash
flowleap --json summary EP1234567      # biblio + legal + family + term
flowleap ops claims EP1234567          # claims text
flowleap ops description EP1234567     # full description
```

## Finding Gaps

Cross the academic hits against the patent hits: topics heavily published but
lightly patented (open R&D) versus the reverse (crowded IP). For a structured
run use `recipe-academic-literature-review`.
