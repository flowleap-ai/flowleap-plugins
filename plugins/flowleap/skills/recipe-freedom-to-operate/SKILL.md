description: Freedom-to-operate clearance for a product or technology — per-feature query generation, dual-database blocking-patent search, and legal-status, family, and all-elements claim checks on every live candidate. Trigger when the user asks whether a product or technology can launch without infringing, or requests an FTO/clearance search.

# Recipe: Freedom-to-Operate (FTO) Search

Search for potentially blocking patents for a product or technology. Each
database uses its own query syntax — see `flowleap-uspto` for the USPTO Lucene
grammar.

## Steps

### Step 1: Write Targeted Searches

Write a query per key product feature, in each database's own syntax, yourself
(method in `flowleap-patent`; ODP Lucene in `flowleap-uspto`). For each
feature: extract its specific noun phrases, build the CQL around the
discriminating ones, and probe the count — FTO is a recall search, so refine
toward broad (drop classifications, OR in synonyms) rather than precise:

```bash
# EPO CQL count probe for feature 1 (read `total` from the payload)
flowleap --json tools run search_patents query='<CQL for feature 1>' range=1-1 details=false
# Repeat for each feature; USPTO Lucene queries are title + metadata only
```

Done when every key feature has a probed EPO CQL query and a USPTO ODP query.

### Step 2: Search for Potentially Blocking Patents

```bash
flowleap --json patent search --query "<CQL for feature 1>" --limit 20
flowleap --json uspto search --query "<recommended_query for feature 1>" --limit 20
# Repeat for each feature
```

**A missing patent-data key never narrows a clearance scope.** If one office
answers `provider_keys_required`, search the live office fully and carry the
gated office into the deliverable as an explicit missing-key gap — an
unsearched jurisdiction is not a cleared one, and web-scraped patent data is not
an acceptable substitute for it. Ask for the free key at the end of the turn;
when the user adds it, re-run only that office and merge. See `flowleap-keys`.

Done when both databases have been searched for every feature, or the gated
office is recorded as an open missing-key gap.

### Step 3: Screen to Live, In-Market Candidates

Take the one-call snapshot (bibliography + legal status + family + term) and
keep only patents that are **legally alive** and cover a **jurisdiction you
sell in**:

```bash
flowleap --json summary <patent-number>
```

Or, if you need the pieces separately:

```bash
flowleap --json ops legal <patent-number>     # is it active? which states?
flowleap --json ops family <patent-number>    # where is it filed?
```

Read the jurisdiction from the right field. `family` names the **offices** the
invention published in; for an EP member that is one entry ("EP") and says
nothing about countries. The countries are the `designatedStates` on the legal
status (`extensionStates` for extension/validation states) — for a European
regional filing those ARE its designated-state coverage. Then subtract the states
lapsed per the `PG25`/`PGFP` events, which each carry their own `state`: a patent
designating DE and still paying fees there blocks you in Germany, one lapsed
there does not.

The designation is rolled up from the AK event with the latest date. If that
event carried no readable list an older one answers, so the set can be a
superseded, **wider** one — it can name a state the applicant has since dropped.
For a clearance call that is the dangerous direction, so read the `AK` rows in
`events` before you flag or clear a market on the roll-up alone.

Done when every survivor is both in force and designates a sales jurisdiction;
drop the rest.

### Step 4: All-Elements Claim Mapping

For each surviving blocker, pull its claims and map product features against
every element of each independent claim:

```bash
flowleap --json ops claims <patent-number>
```

A claim clears only if at least one of its elements is absent from the product.
Done when every independent claim of every survivor is either cleared (≥1 element
absent) or flagged as a live infringement risk.

## Output

FTO data package per live blocking patent:
- Legal status (active, expired, abandoned) and remaining term
- Geographic reach against your sales jurisdictions — family members for the
  offices, `designatedStates` minus lapsed states for an EP filing's countries
- Per-claim all-elements verdict: cleared or at-risk

If the full skill pack is installed, continue with `recipe-infringement-charting`
to chart the at-risk claims element by element.
