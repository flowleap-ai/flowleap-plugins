Trigger when an agent needs European or worldwide patent search results, needs to turn an invention description into a CQL query, or wants to tune a query for recall versus precision.

# FlowLeap Patent

Auth and global flags: see `flowleap-shared`.

In a chat client with the FlowLeap connector, call the tools named in the `flowleap-shared` connector table instead of these commands.

EP/WO search runs on the user's own EPO patent-data key. A
`provider_keys_required` error is a **user-action stop for that office, never an
exhausted route**: do not fall back to web-scraped patent data, deliver whatever
the live office (US via `flowleap uspto search`) returns in full, name the gap as
a missing-key gap, and ask for the free key at the end of the turn. A zero-result
search is not a gate — reformulate and persist as normal. See `flowleap-keys`.

## Search Patents

```bash
flowleap patent search --query <query> [flags]
```

Runs the `search_patents` tool (`provider: epo_ops`) on the Tools facade — the
single agent surface for patent data. Returns results with publication number,
title, applicant, and date; the per-source provider route this used to call is
a retired endpoint. You never name the surface yourself: the command carries it.

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--query`, `-q` | EPO CQL query (required) — e.g. `ti="battery separator"` | — |
| `--limit` | Maximum results (1-100) | `10` |
| `--countries` | Country filter, comma-separated (e.g. `EP,WO`) | none |
| `--count-only` | Only report the result total (cheap probe, no documents) | `false` |

Jurisdiction is set with `--countries` — `patent search` has no `--source` flag
(that flag belongs to `academic search`, for `scholar` vs `arxiv`).

For US-specific searches use `flowleap uspto search` (ODP Lucene syntax).

### Response Format (JSON)

Returns an array of results, each carrying a document identifier, title,
applicant(s), publication date, and abstract, for example:

```json
[
  {
    "docId": "EP1234567.A1",
    "title": "Solar Panel with Improved Efficiency",
    "applicants": ["SolarCorp Inc."],
    "publicationDate": "20240115",
    "abstract": "..."
  }
]
```

Field names are illustrative — inspect a live `--json` response for the exact
keys. Strip the kind suffix (`EP1234567.A1` → `EP1234567`) to use the document
identifier as the `<patent-number>` argument to `ops` and the tools facade.

## Writing the Query — You Write the CQL

There is no server-side query builder: you turn the description into CQL
yourself, with the three steps below. None of them is optional.

### Step 1 — extract the terms (mandatory, before any CQL)

List every specific noun phrase in the description: materials, mechanisms,
subject matter ("sulfide glass ceramic", "foreign object detection", "prior
art"). These are your candidate discriminating terms. For each one you leave out
of the query, state why. Uncertainty about phrasing ("glass ceramic" vs
"glass-ceramic") is a reason to OR both forms, never to drop the term. The most
common failure is dropping the phrase that *is* the invention.

### Step 2 — write the query

Every query needs at least one **discriminating** term — one that separates this
invention from the millions of generic patents in its technology area. A CPC
code is never discriminating: it names a neighbourhood, not a house. For "AI for
patent analysis", the discriminating term is `ta="patent analysis"` — never just
`ta="artificial intelligence"`, and `ic=G06N` alone returns every
machine-learning patent ever filed.

```bash
flowleap patent search --query 'pa=GOOGLE* AND ta="machine learning" AND ic=G06N' --limit 20
```

**Fields** — do not guess field names; every field in your query must be here:

| Field | Meaning | Wildcards |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `ta` | title + abstract combined — **preferred**; costs one term instead of `ti` + `ab` | yes |
| `ti` / `ab` | title only / abstract only | yes |
| `pa` | applicant (`pa=GOOGLE*`, `pa="TESLA INC"`) | yes |
| `in` | inventor (`in=SMITH*`) | yes |
| `ic` / `cpc` / `cl` | IPC / CPC / all classifications (`ic=G06N`, `cpc=G06N3/08`) | **no** |
| `pn` / `ap` / `pr` | publication / application / priority number | **no** |
| `ct` | citation — documents citing this one (`ct=EP1234567`) | no |
| `pd` | publication date — `pd=2023`, `pd>=2020`, `pd within "2020 2023"` | no |

**Hard constraints — these produce API errors, not bad results:**

- Maximum ~10 terms per query (`MaximumTotalTerms` beyond that).
- No wildcards on `ic`/`cpc`/`cl`/`pn` (`TruncationForbidden`).
- Terms must be at least 3 characters — OPS rejects shorter prefixes with
  `400 CLIENT.PrefixTooShort`. Spell the word out (`ti="ultraviolet"`, not
  `ti="uv"`).
- Operators `AND`/`OR`/`NOT` uppercase; phrases in `"double quotes"`.
- **Grouping: parentheses group complete `field=value` clauses. Repeat the
  field inside the parentheses; never put the parentheses inside the value.**

```text
(ic=H02J OR ic=B60L)                        valid — covers two classes
(ta="glass ceramic" OR ta="glass-ceramic")  valid — covers both word forms
ta=(turbine OR blade)                       NOT CQL — hard OPS 404
```

**Choosing terms:** `ta` carries the discrimination (the specific subject
matter, not the technology area). A classification is never discriminating on
its own — pair it with a `ta` term, and when the invention spans classes, OR
the classes: `(ic=G06N OR ic=G06F)`. Aim for two or three discriminating terms:
one extra term routinely cuts a count by two orders of magnitude. For
combination inventions ("drone inspecting turbine blades"), the *pair* of terms
is the discrimination — `ta=drone AND ta="turbine blade"` — so keep both;
dropping the category word loses the invention.

### Step 3 — probe the count (mandatory, before trusting any results)

Use `--count-only`: it asks for range 1-1 with `details=false` (no
per-document bibliography fan-out), so a probe is cheap — a count is all you
want here:

```bash
flowleap --json patent search --query 'ta="foreign object" AND ta=charging' --count-only
```

The JSON payload is `{ query, total }`. (Equivalent raw-tool probe:
`flowleap --json tools run search_patents query='…' range=1-1 details=false`.)
Note: `total` counts the full CQL result set — a `--countries` filter narrows
the returned documents, never the total.

- **Over ~1,000 hits:** too broad — add the next discriminating term from your
  Step 1 list and probe again.
- **Under 10:** too narrow — drop the classification, OR in synonyms, use the
  parent CPC class, widen dates.

A query you never probed is a guess; in a prior-art search a query returning
thousands of hits instead of tens means the closest art is never seen. A
prior-art search starts broad and narrows — you cannot notice what a too-narrow
query never returned.

### Recall vs precision

A judgement, not a setting:

- **Broad** (recall — novelty, FTO): drop the classification, widen dates, OR
  in synonyms, use the parent CPC class.
- **Precise** (precision — closest few documents to read in full): add a second
  `ta` term, narrow the classification to a subgroup, tighten dates.
- **Balanced** (default): one discriminating `ta` term, one classification, one
  date bound.

## Verify CPC Codes — Never Guess

CPC reclassifies (photovoltaics moved from `H01L31` to `H10F` in 2023 and the
backfile was rewritten), so a remembered code may silently return the wrong
corpus. The official, version-stamped scheme is queryable:

```bash
flowleap patstat query "SELECT symbol, title FROM flowleap.cpc_scheme WHERE title ILIKE '%photovoltaic%' ORDER BY symbol LIMIT 15" --question "candidate CPC codes for photovoltaics"
```

Read the results at the right level: a 4-char class carries only the headline
(`H10F` = "inorganic semiconductor devices sensitive to radiation"); the
specific technology titles live in its **groups** (`H10F10/00`, `H10F71/00` …).
Match keywords against group titles, then search with the 4-char class
(`ic=H10F`) or the exact group (`cpc=H10F10/00`).

## Workflow: Description to Patent Results

1. Extract the candidate terms from the description (Step 1).
2. Write the CQL (Step 2) and probe the count (Step 3); refine until workable.
3. Run the search: `flowleap --json patent search --query "<CQL>" --limit 20`.
   The JSON payload is `{ total, docs }`. Results arrive in EPO OPS default
   order (no relevance ranking — recent publications tend to come first), so
   read the whole page, not just the top hits; the CQL itself is the only
   relevance control.
